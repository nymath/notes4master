\usepackage{graphicx}
\usepackage{ctex}
%Lets you put graphics into your document.  I won't go into that here.
\usepackage{setspace}
%This is George Greenwade's package.  You can set spacing to be one-half or double using the following commands right here in the preamble:
\onehalfspacing
%\doublespacing would use double-spacing.
%\usepackage{hyperref}  %This allows you to make hyperlinks in your pdf and also within the document itself. We do not need this now but it could be useful later.
\usepackage{wasysym} %You can make smiley faces with this package. There are other symbols, too.  Google it.  Again, we likely will not use this.
\usepackage{verbatim} %This allows you to include LaTeX commands in your document (as text) that do not execute.  I use this to show you the LaTeX to type.
\usepackage{arcs}%You only need this if you are creating notation for arcs in geometry.  See Section 6.10

%What follows are called "Proclamations."  They are displayed text environments.
\theoremstyle{definition}
%This sets the style for proclamations.  The options are plain, definition, and remark.  You can try all three to see what they do.  "definition" does not put things in italics
%Since I do not like my theorems in italics, I use "definition."
%The following set up your declarations. For example, the first one writes "Definition" and the section number after you begin a definition. This helps with automatic numbering.
\newtheorem{definition}{Definition}[chapter]
\newtheorem{example}{Example}[chapter]
\newtheorem{theorem}{Theorem}[chapter]
\newtheorem{proposition}{Proposition}[section]
\newtheorem*{fact}{Fact}
\newtheorem{remark}{Remark}
\newtheorem{corollary}{Corollary}[section]
\newtheorem{lemma}{Lemma}[section]

% I do not want my facts numbered, so notice what I used.

%Next you can have some defintions, or shortcuts you use often.  Youwill come up with these for things you find yourself typing a lot.
